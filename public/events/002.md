# "GREAT HOLES ARE DIGGED" // 8.10.5016u

The events of "Last Breath" ring for days throughout the front. Whatever **ERGO PROXY** was it was new. No TLF unit had ever worked this way, no unit of the TLF had ever fought so hard. The willingness to die for their cause was fierce and unheard of. What's more - the front had moved back. The TLF were pushing harder than they had in years. You came through the other side of your first day as Pilots with scars, but alive. Now the focus was turning, driving back the TLF was a priority and they were using the momentum of their new offensive to run over as much ground as they could.

You've heard whispers of the next job - finding and taking out a TLF Field Commander, one who was responsible for the deaths of civilians and combatants alike. Known to travel in his own Mech Frame, taking him out would mean less civilian deaths and maybe stalling the frontline from moving any further East. Along for the ride is some backup - **APEX PREDATOR**, a strong pilot but one whose morals would worry anyone.
