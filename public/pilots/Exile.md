*This is the profile-spec you asked for on **KHAYRADI**. It better be the last one you need – if I keep accessing BLD personnel files like this, it’s going to get noticed sooner or later.*
 
*P.S - I actually met this guy once, during his onboarding. He’s a real livewire, he’ll try to con the flexsuit off your back if you give him half a chance.*

**NAME**: SULDRED KHAYRADI IV 
 
**DOB**: 4666u
 
Contracted with **BLACKLIGHT** for just over half a year, **“EXILE”** was admitted to the Pilot Training Programme despite several complaints from our Union representative. Khayradi is, by birth, a high noble of the **HOUSE OF STONE** – one of the most prominent Karrakin Baronies. Despite a childhood of luxury on Altiamos, and a promising aptitude for Baronic mech dueling, Khayradi left his homeworld in 5003u to escape the suffocation of noble culture.
 
Seeking a freedom he’d never known, Khayradi travelled Neapolitan and Diasporan space. Khayradi was on the Long Rim within a year, bouncing from card tables to dice dens as he dropped his Baronic wealth into bet after bet for more than a decade. Union-sourced files show that Khayradi eventually attempted a return to Baronic space, but was apprehended at the Altiamos Orbital Waystation and officially exiled by Stonelord Hyderad-Cannamos. Assumedly, we understand, for blowing most of his inheritance during backroom card games on the Rim.  
 
A year later, after demonstrating his duelist skillset to recruiter agents, he was placed on the Blacklight Pilot Programme.
 
An impulsive problem-solver, Khayradi has exhibited ingenious tactical insight in sim training, albeit with an over-aggressive combat style that prizes showmanship over strategy. Combined with Blacklight’s status as a contractor, this was enough to overrule the Union’s registered complaints against Khayradi – believing him an embedded agent of the Karrakin Royal Intelligence Service (KRIS). So far, the only marks on his Blacklight record that I can find are from the Quartermaster shutting down his warehouse dice games.  
 
With a return to the Baronies likely impossible, we expect Khayradi is looking to restore his name with battlefield heroics – or to make enough commission to buy his way back into the ranks of Karrakin nobility. Expect “EXILE” to take on increased risks for fame or valour, and to flaunt his combat ability whenever he is able.  
 
*I don’t need to tell you how confidential this is – you owe me for pulling this. *
