# Pilot Dossier

- Born and raised on a Union Agri World

- Worked for **Blacklight** most of her Life

- Started as a Dispatch/Coms officer but soon came dissatisfied and upset with her work as she sent her soldiers what could often be their last mission

- Wanting to do more then just send her fellow Blacklight operatives to their death, Lucy trained and worked as a omnihook operator embedded into a Blacklight Mechanised Infantry Division. Gaining the nickname  **"Dispatch"** due to her cool cat demeanour and smooth radio voice even in the most stressful situations

- After years of service with the Lucy became desensitised to the war effort, the only thing that mattered was making sure all the boys and girls of her unit made it back and she used every available asset and method to see that through.

- Applied to the Blacklight pilot program in 50XXU to see her mission through bring everyone back alive
