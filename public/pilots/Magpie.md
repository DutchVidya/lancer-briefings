## Alexandria Rowland | "Magpie"

## BLACKLIGHT INTERNAL CONTRACTOR FILE | ACCESS BY NON-AUTHORISED PERSONNEL CAN LEAD TO DISMISSAL

**Name:** Alexandria Rowland

**DOB:** N/A

Born to a group of ice miners, **MAGPIE** was recruited into a local anarchist cell at one point and then eventually caught in the act of destroying an Oxygen Recycling Factory. The Mining Company, likely to keep costs down, sent her to serve on an outer rim planet, hard labour. That far out, it is impossible for Union or other local authorities to reliably monitor working conditions and it was exploitave. Less a corporate penal colony and more like a slave camp. No oversight, no one truly in charge. Still young and yearning for freedom, it was inevitable that if you send your prisoners known for exploding things to the one place - they inevitably blow something up. The prisoners there caused so much local damage and were such a nuisance that it eventually made it's way, through some finance report or another, that the camp needed oversight. The paperwork leads to a number of buyouts, corporate hitjobs and then somewhere down the line an entirely different corporation owned the facilities and the people that came with it. 

By this point this tiny system was a mess, anarchist groups, open rebellion and the remnants of Corpo security forces trying not to get eaten alive by the people they had abused. With the buyouts "Freedom" came to these people. Pirate groups were destroyed, rebellions were brought to heel by force or through treaties with their new corporate heads of state. Lots of people died, most of them innocent.

By this time **MAGPIE** was serving reconnaissance for new homes in the system's polar regions, with most of the system brought to heel (and administration made simpler with the Corporation's NHP running things), those left out in the often literal cold were what were left of dissidents and rebel groups. It was not an easy world to live in, but live in it they did.

We sought Alexandria out ourselves, part of ongoing and far reaching corporate talent programs. Her talent for **EXPLOSIVES** and **SABOTAGE** made her an obvious candidate, and we sweetened the deal with promises of being able to get off planet to find her original family. We made it clear on her hiring - we would offer no support to that role ourselves, but no one else was hiring known and active wanted criminals, not even Mirrorsmoke wanted her, but we did. So we got her a clean slate and off them planet imprisoning her. What she does in her free time is hers, so long as it doesn't involve detonating any important facilities or waging war on someone without our say so.
