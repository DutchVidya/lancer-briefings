## RECOVERED TLF PILOTS COMMS LOG

<TLF|Sabretooth> God damnit this bullshit again

<TLF|BigCheese> You getting it too? All this BS about folds?

<TLF|Sabretooth> Yeah it's just flooding my syslog constantly. It's on every channel as well

<TLF|GR13F3R> Found the source, I'm going for it.

Bursts of digital interference can be heard, followed by the dull crump of an explosion

<TLF|BigCheese> Griefer's gone - He just cooked off or something!

<TLF|Sabretooth> Screw this, I'm withdrawing. I don't wanna get roasted like that!

Ouroboros is a self proclaimed "Seer of the Convolutions of the Metat Aun". This obscure sect of Aunic belief believes that whilst Os may communicate with Metat Aun, only those who have delved within the forbidden foldings of reality itself can truly understand the whims of the deity, and that Metat Aun will comminicate its wants directly to those  who have glimpsed the inner workings of reality.

Despite her appearance as some sort of priest or herald, Ouroboros has no real religious authority, and is in fact a skilled hacker, and a capable technical fighter. Exiled by the Ascendency, along with the rest of her sect for the heretical beliefs, she travelled into the Diaspora, seeking to spread the messages of Metat Aun. There was not much love for this in Union space, and so Ouroboros eventually turned to her technical skills to earn a living, coming into Blacklight's employ some time during the **TYRNIAN CIVIL WAR**, her skillset was quickly put to use sabotaging TLF systems and equipment. Whilst her methods are known to be unorthodox, Blacklight is no stranger to unusual methods, and gladly make use of her services, for now at least.

# Pilot Appearance

- Ouroboros retains much of her former Aunic garb - Preferring to wear a loose set of maroon robes over her hardsuit. Intricate geometrical synthtoos are worked across her olive skin, creating elaborate patterns. Anyone staring at these for too long may notice the patterns never seem to be the same. Numerous piercings and trinkets create similar patterns, catching the light in seemingly unnatural ways. Her dark hair is woven into a mixture of braids and plaits, and her milky eyes are framed by heavy tattooing and makeup.

Something about Ouroboros makes you a little uncomfortable, though it's tough to put your finger on exactly what it is.
