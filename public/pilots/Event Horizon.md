## Dalt Stirad // "Event Horizon"

*Wee, sleekit, cow’rin, tim’rous beastie,*

*O, what a panic’s in thy breastie!*

*Thou need na start awa sae hasty,*

*Wi’ bickering brattle!*

*I wad be laith to rin an’ chase thee,*

*Wi’ murd’ring pattle!*  

*I’m truly sorry man’s dominion,*
*Has broken nature’s social union,*
*An’ justifies that ill opinion,*
*Which makes thee startle*
*At me, thy poor, earth-born companion,*
*An’ fellow-mortal!*
