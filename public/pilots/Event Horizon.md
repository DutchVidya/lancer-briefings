## Dalt Stirad // "Event Horizon"


*'Cause I walk through the valley of the shadow of death*

*And I fear no evil because I'm blind*

*Oh, and I walk beside the still waters and they restore my soul*

*But I know when I die my soul is damned*

## BLACKLIGHT INTERNAL CONTRACTOR FILE | ACCESS BY NON-AUTHORISED PERSONNEL CAN LEAD TO DISMISSAL

**Name:** Dalt Stirad
**DOB:** N/A

Currently seconded to the **Blacklight Pilot Programme**, 'Event Horizon' came to us having already worked for one of our competitors. According to legal documents available on the Omninet, Stirad worked for **Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company** for several years as a Pilot and was attached to **MSMC Detachment 054 "Corporate Buyout"**. Detachment 054 predominately worked in legal space contracts but was known for involvement in assisting smaller corpo states with power grabs and wetwork. Detachment 054, according to MSMC Legal records, were the unit directly involved in what is now known as the **Orion Disaster**.

Whilst serving with 054, Stirad's unit was tasked with the suppression of a a sector of the Long Rim in favour of a small corpo state. As part of efforts, Detachment 054 appears to have engaged against enemy forces around **Orion Station**. Believing it would be safer to engage infrastructure and force a surrender, Detachment 054's CO and Legal team authorised the unit to engage the station from external positions.

Nothing in the legal record indicates how it happened, but Orion Station eventually suffered enough damage that Life Support and other critical systems began to fail. 12 hours after combat began, Orion Station detonated, killing everyone aboard. Official accounts list the death toll anywhere between 200 and 800, taking into account that the stations' actual population were never subject to official Census attempts and it is unknown how many families were aboard.

Legally, Detachment 054 were cleared of wrongdoing but records show Stirad left the Company shortly after, before coming to us.

As a member of Blacklight, Stirad's technical skills have been proven time and time again. Comments by his team leaders indicate that above all he does not seem the type to have been part of the Orion Disaster willingly. Whatever happened at Orion, he is clearly affected by it, and it has delayed hios recommendation to the Pilot Programme by several years. Pysch evals show a sense of regret, but not instability.
